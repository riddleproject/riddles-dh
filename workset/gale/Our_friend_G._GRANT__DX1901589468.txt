Our friend' G. GRANT1 today takes the lead in the RI DqLE TOU RNAMENT. TEirESTIOH. No.1. Foundation .ord.
From the day Ifirst beheld thee, When thy.glances on me fell, Has thy form been e'er before me Like unto a magio spell. * E'er before me like a shadow, Sweet as brpak of summer day; Since that time, in languid dreaming, I have thought of you.each day. And in restless mien I ponder; And, whene'er I view your gaze, In the realms of love I wander, And my head is in amaze. Gross Words. Ah, who can tell with what ecstatic bliss I seal affection's vow with one sweet this. Herein, my dear readers, if you're so inclined, Instruction, amusement, and learning you'll find; The beasts of all countries in numbers are many, So please to walk up-the admission's one penny. As a schoolboy. I trow, 'twas a terror to me, Though now a companion it often will be. Though this be light, I've somewhere read 'Twill give you, p'raps, A heavy head. I will give you a hint are we further proceed, sir; By Jove, I've given you all that you need, sir. You may be endowed with all manner of wealth, But true happinessis not your lot: There is something yet wanted which riches can't buy, And this you perhaps have not got. It were a trusty friend, I'll not ignore it; While walking in the fields this morn I bore it. 0 Peace the goddess, would that she this day Could hold supreme, invulnerable sway. To wish to obtain it May be your intent; But not mixed with fat To nigh eighty per cent. Plenty of this our noble Jack hasseen, And by its power has sorely troubled been. G. GRANT, Bayswater. DIAMOND PUZZLE. No. 2. My first's a Roman numeral That stands for ten times ten; My next it is an adjective, Which you all ought to ken.
