'T is a comical-Institution, Loves in gay colours'to shine, This well-principled-Institution. Not only in sunshine bright, Like a generous-Institution, Comes out well, in clouds and night, Unprejudiced, broad-Institution. Ready to guide, nothing loth, Unlike a cramped-Institution. Tories and Radicals both Multifarious-Institution ! There's none at home or abroad Who can say of this-Institution, It would not its help afford. Mark ! my second if robbed of a part, Of a primary, leading part, Most surely presages the sad decay Of a wonderful-Institution.
